<td>American Crocodile
The American crocodile can be seen throughout the lowlands of Costa Rica, 
gliding along rivers or sunning on muddy banks. It has a long, strong 
tail, a scaly suit of armor and a very powerful set of jaws. The American 
crocodile’s eyes, ears and nostrils are located on the top of its head, 
giving the croc a low profile while swimming through the water.
Thanks to their short legs, American crocodiles generally crawl along on 
their bellies, however, they are capable of “galloping” at a surprisingly 
fast pace. In the water, they often use their bodies and tails to swim 
rapidly in short bursts when necessary.
An adult male American crocodile averages 13 feet in length and weighs 
approximately 400 pounds; his female counterpart is about 10 feet long and 
weighs only 160 pounds. The species can live up to 70 years, and is 
partial to warm, brackish waters – its habitat consists of river mouths, 
salt lakes, brackish rivers, estuaries and even the ocean. American 
crocodiles are most often found between southern Florida and Peru, with a 
high concentration in Costa Rica.</td>
<td>Costa Rican Cloud Forest:
Deforestation eliminated most of the world’s tropical montane cloud 
forests years ago and continues today.  Unfortunately even areas like 
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve  which are protected from logging are 
threatened as rising world temperatures move the elevation where the 
clouds first form higher and higher. Scientists have found that plants
and animals from lower climactic associations have been encroaching 
on the reserve and other Costa Rican cloud forest areas for decades. 
The lowland rainforests are creeping up the hills and the cloudforests 
are being pushed off the mountaintops.  Visit while you still can.</td>

<td>Sloth doing what sloths do best!:
There are two species of sloths: two-toed and three-toed. Although the 
name is misleading given that all sloths have three toes. Actually the 
species name refers to the number of fingers. But two-toed sounds way 
better than two-finger! So let’s not duel on that. Their main physical 
differentiation, apart from the fingers, is their coloration (At least for 
the two species of sloths in Costa Rica).
Three-toed sloths tend to be a grey color, with a white face mask that 
makes them look smiley all the time. Two toed sloths tend to be more beige 
to brown and lack the face mask but still offer a great smile. Three-toed 
sloths also possess an extra cervical allowing them to turn their head 270 
degrees! Also three-toed sloths are diurnal while two-toed are nocturnal.</td>
